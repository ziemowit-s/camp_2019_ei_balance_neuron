	Minimal kinetic model for GABA-A receptors
	==========================================

  Model of Destexhe, Mainen & Sejnowski, 1994:

	(closed) + T <-> (open)

  The simplest kinetics are considered for the binding of transmitter (T)
  to open postsynaptic receptors.   The corresponding equations are in
  similar form as the Hodgkin-Huxley model:

	dr/dt = alpha * [T] * (1-r) - beta * r

	I = gmax * [open] * (V-Erev)

  where [T] is the transmitter concentration and r is the fraction of 
  receptors in the open form.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Based on voltage-clamp recordings of GABAA receptor-mediated currents in rat
  hippocampal slices (Otis and Mody, Neuroscience 49: 13-32, 1992), this model
  was fit directly to experimental recordings in order to obtain the optimal
  values for the parameters (see Destexhe, Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This mod file includes a mechanism to describe the time course of transmitter
  on the receptors.  The time course is approximated here as a brief pulse
  triggered when the presynaptic compartment produces an action potential.
  The trigger is sensed by the NET_RECEIVE function attached at the
  last, which sets the value of C to Cmax once the trigger is received.
